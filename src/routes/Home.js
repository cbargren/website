    <Title>About Me</Title>
    <Body>
      <p>
        I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer with {yearsExperience} years of
        experience and {yearsReactExperience} years of experience working with
        React. I worked at <a href="https://axosoft.com">Axosoft</a> from Jan
        2011 to Mar 2017 where I worked initially on an ASP.net MVC-based SPA
        for project management and bug tracking and later moved to working on{' '}
        <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a>, an Electron-based
        desktop Git GUI application built using React and Redux.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then went on to work at{' '}
        <a href="https://www.traxtech.com">Trax Technologies</a> from Mar 2017
        to August 2018 where I worked on Freight Audit and Payment management
        applications as the lead Web Architect of a cross-regional team of
        engineers. There, I facilitated the replacement of a group of outdated
        Ember web applications with a performant, modular React/Redux web
        infrastructure that could easily be expanded upon as business needs
        changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I'm part of a fully remote team at{' '}
        <a href="https://www.vorstella.com">Vorstella</a>, where we're working
        on a machine learning-based infrastructure optimization platform. I'm
        the lead front-end engineer there, working to build a performant,
        responsive user experience where users can quickly and easily monitor
        their clusters for anomalies that signal a problem before they begin
        impacting users.

        Man, you really don't have anything better to do than to read about my
        lame personal website? Alright then. ðŸ˜„ It's built using React and Redux
        plus some other handy tools like styled-components and font-awesome. You
        might want to ask "Chris, isn't Redux way overkill for a simple website
        like this?" Well, you're not wrong! But hey, I'm doing this for funsies,
        so why not overengineer it a little bit? Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
